# Asset-Tracking

I demonstrated my capability by designing a user-friendly interface for both administrative portals and the officer's mobile app. 
Additionally, I implemented an algorithm that dynamically tracks officers' live locations, marking them green if within their assigned area and 
triggering a red alert with notification if they venture outside the designated zone. My skills extend to incorporating automated facial recognition 
checks at random intervals, promoting fairness and transparency in police monitoring

Throughout the development of the ground personnel monitoring tool, I engaged with diverse set of technologies, showcasing my versatility 
in software development. project involved the strategic utilization of C, C++, Python, ESP8266, Embedded Systems and key libraries like OpenCV 
and NumPy to implement algorithms for location tracking and facial recognition. Database management was streamlined through MongoDB, 
ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of information. The project also harnessed the power of Google Maps API for real-time location mapping.
